- Create other architectures per effort so that less models are required as the starting point. What about mutation? Done!
- Extract all the top N candidates metrics after EBE for H testing.
- Df for tracking

A rational curve extrapolation model:
“a deliberately minimal extrapolator that is good enough to enable the decision task.”
While more sophisticated models exist, our objective is not to maximize extrapolation fidelity per se, but to build the lightest-possible decision procedure that can separate promising neural candidates from hopeless ones under tight resource budgets.
